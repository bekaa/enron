# enron
predicting persons of interest in enron company using supervised Machine learning algorithms.  
This project is a part of udacity data-analysis Nanodegree.    
Read the report at https://anaconda.org/bekaa/enron/notebook or the file enron.ipynb .   
The main script is poi_id.py which does all the magic.    
The other scripts : 
* dict_to_csv.py : covert a dictionary to a csv file format.
* feature_format.py : have two useful functions (copyrights of this script goes to the udacity's nanodegree)
* algorithm.py : implements many supervised algorithms.
* tester.py : evaluate the classifier . (copyrights of this script goes to the udacity's nanodegree)
All of these scripts are used in the poi_id.py script.
